# AlgorithmExer
Implements some algorithm and data structure in Algorithm 4th Edition.
Make each file have a main which can be run independently maybe better, will do it later.
Not very familiar with Java, so for now i just use Intellij create a project to run them quickly.
It covers

## Fibonacci Generator
Recursive and non-recursive generator.

## Josephus Problem
Use circular linked list to solve it.

## Search
 - Binary
 - Bitonic

## Sort
 - Bubble
 - Quick
 - Selection
 - Insertion
 - Shell
 - Merge

## BinaryTree
 - Generate
 - Iterate
   - LDR (in sorted, middle order)
   - DLR (Data Left Child)
   - LRD (back order)
   - level Iterate

## BuildTreeByIteration
 - Build tree and calculate back order by pre and in order.
 - Build tree and calculate pre order by back and in order.

## Balanced Binary Tree
 - Generation - Insertion balance

## Sum
 - Fast ThreeSum

## Expression Evaluator
Very simple one, can only evaluate expression with all brackets.

## Miscs
 - Permutation
 - Decimal to Hex
 - Binary/Hex to Decimal
